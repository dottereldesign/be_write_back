## What is bewriteback?

**bewriteback** is a modern web app for anyone who constantly copies, pastes, and juggles text, code, links, or notes throughout their day.

Think of it as a supercharged, user-friendly **clipboard manager** that lives entirely in your browser ‚Äî no accounts, no servers, no privacy worries.

- **Copy** something.
- **Paste** it into bewriteback.
- **Name** it.
- **Recall** or **reuse** it at any time ‚Äî with one click.

All your snippets are saved locally and instantly accessible, organized as **cards** and **folders**.

---

## Why does it exist?

**The Problem:**
- Modern workflows rely heavily on copy-paste, but browsers don‚Äôt let you _save_ anything for later.
- System clipboards are ephemeral and often hard to browse, clear, or organize.
- Existing clipboard managers are mostly native apps, require permissions, or are overkill for most users.
- Sensitive data shouldn‚Äôt leave your device or require cloud sync.

**bewriteback solves these by:**
- Running **100% in-browser** (PWA-ready: install as an app if you want).
- Never uploading your data ‚Äî your notes/snippets/cards/folders live _only_ in your browser‚Äôs local storage.
- Offering a clear, simple, and beautiful UI for pasting, labeling, sorting, organizing, and recalling your important copied text.

---

## Who is it for?

- **Developers**: Store code snippets, API keys (careful!), command-line tricks, or regexes.
- **Writers & Editors**: Keep blocks of reusable text, canned replies, or research snippets.
- **Students & Researchers**: Collect citations, quotes, and ideas as you browse.
- **Support & Helpdesk**: Prepare responses, macros, or common solutions for instant use.
- **Anyone** who copies and pastes frequently ‚Äî and wishes the clipboard had a memory!

---
